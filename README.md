## Personal Projects

- **Prompt Optimization** – This project explores prompt-based legal text classification, focusing on terms of service clauses from 50 consumer contracts. The goal is to classify clauses as fair or unfair and investigate how much classification performance can be improved through prompt optimisation.

- **RAG** – This project demonstrates a simple implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using LangChain on a thesis PDF. It evaluates how retrieval integration can optimise large language model outputs compared to standard prompting.
